## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- Custom CSS with variables
- Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned how to use CSS variables to easily manage colors and styling properties.
- I also learned how to reset default styles in CSS to ensure a consistent layout across all browsers.
- Using Figma for visual elements helped me understand proportions and alignment before starting to code.

```
css
:root {
    --White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --Slate300: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    --Slate500: hsl(216, 15%, 48%);
    --Slate900: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}

/* Réinitialisation des styles par défaut */
*,
*::before,
*::after {
    margin: 0;
    /* Supprime les marges par défaut */
    padding: 0;
    /* Supprime les espacements internes par défaut */
    box-sizing: border-box;
    /* Intègre le contenu, les bordures et le padding dans la largeur/hauteur */
}
```

### Continued development

In the future, I want to explore using a CSS preprocessor like Sass to organize styles more efficiently.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com) – Was a useful resource for clarifying CSS concepts and solving specific development issues.
